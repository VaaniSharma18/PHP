<?php 
//opening tag
echo "Hello, World!\n"; //The echo function is faster than the print() function. //may use parentheses with the echo function as echo ("string"); but it isn’t compulsory because echo isn’t really a function.
print("Hello, World!\n");
printf("%s\n","Hello, World!");




//the closing tag of a PHP code block at the end of a file is optional. The code would still execute properly even if the closing tag is missing.
